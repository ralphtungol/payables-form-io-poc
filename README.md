## FAQ

#### How to change the port used when running the project locally

Change the environment variable PORT defined in the `start` script in the `package.json` file.

For example, to run the project using port 3002 you can update `package.json` as follows:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development REACT_APP_ENV=local PORT=3002 webpack serve --open --env webpackEnv=development"
  }
}
```
